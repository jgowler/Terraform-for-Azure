4. Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
5. Deploy an Azure Web App and App Service Plan
6. Create an Azure SQL Database with a Private Endpont
7. Deply an Azure Container Registry

---
## Part 5 - Deploy an Azure Web App and App Service Plan
---

For this only a few resources would be needed to create the Web App and Service Plan as it does nto require much to get set up:

```
Resource Group
Service Plan
Azure Web App
```

As this is very basic I will be adding some more resources to the deployment to make use of monitoring and logging, telemetry, and managed SSL certificates:

```
Storage account
Application insights
Certificate binding
Azure Key vault + policies
Managed SSL Certificate
Log Analytics Workspace
```
